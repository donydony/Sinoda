## Meeting Notes and Decisions


There weren't any unfinished tasks, everything was finished on time.

Practices that will move on is dividing work up into mini groups, and assigning major stories to groups.

Next sprint onward, we will have a dedicated person for paperwork. Jialu, will be dedicated paperwork/notetaking person, backup will be Jishnu. They will be the ones in charge of making sure the paperwork is completed and submitted on time.

The way we initally divided up the work was inefficient, we will be doing a better job at the start of the next sprint so its more efficently done, and everyone properly knows what they have to accomplish.

Best experiance for us was playing around with unity and seeing how it works, the worst experiance was when something happened and we had to spend a lot of time figuring out why it happened.
