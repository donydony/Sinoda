### Features to be presented and explanation

#### Front End Features

The front end features that were made for this sprint, were the main menu components along with music.

The main menu component in the front end is comprised of two parts, a general menu, along with a settings menu.

The general menu lets us access the settings menu, play the game, as well as quit the game.

The settings menu, allows us to edit settings such as whether the game plays in windowed mode, or fullscreen. The volume of the music and sounds. The aspect ratio and the resolution.

#### Back End Features

The backend portion of the front end features deals mainly with the scripts/functions that are enabling the front end to work.

For the mainmenu component there is a script in the backend that allows it to load different scenes such as starting the game or the settings scene or even quitting.

The settings script, allows us to return to the main menu and control the fullscreen, aspect ratio etc.

The volume control script allows the settings front end to access the AudioMixer and manipulate it.

The keepAudio script will allow the audio track to keep playing continously without delay.
