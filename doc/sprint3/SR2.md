Meeting Notes and Decisions
Logic and gameboard were unfinished. They will be continued this sprint.

Practices that we will continue to use is dividing work up into mini groups, and assigning major stories to groups.

There was confusion about who was doing what and setting proper deadlines. We will do better to communicate better during stand up meetings.
