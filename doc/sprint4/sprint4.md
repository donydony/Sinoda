# Sprint 4

This document outlines the deliverales that were being worked on during this sprint.
## Deliverables

### Deliverable #1: AI

The first deliverable and a major component was the AI, this AI is basically the computer oponent. As the game is programmed to be played with multiple players, at the current moment it only works with a pass and play method. Having an AI will allow the ability for a user to play the game on thier own. The AI will use and call currently implemented methods in order to take its turns.

### Deliverable #2: Game Playing

A major component for release of this sprint was the working game product, whether that is with playing the game on your own with an AI or with other players. There are three classes that were implemented as part of this deliverable. A board class, a peice class and a player class. These three interact with a controller called the gameboard controller in order to run the game logic and allow the game to be played.

### Deliverable #3: Sound Effects System

This was just an implementation of the sound effect system. It is there to allow the player to get a audio feedback of whether or not what they are doing in the game is working other than just the visual feedback.

### Deliverable #4: Helper Systems

An important part of the other systems working required some mini systems to be implemented. For that the following systems were implemented: 

1. Select Piece State
2. Piece Interaction
3. On Screen Increase Counter Button

These mini systems are used by the major systems outlined above. They help make up important parts of Deliverable #2 and allow the game to function, which in turn is essential for the AI to be able to function.
