 Tabletop simulator has its own version of Sinoda already. Also there are numerous versions of other board games on Tabletop simulator.

Our product is different in that it offers the ability to play against a computer opponent. We are also planning on implementing the ability to save a game, and to see possible moves after selecting a piece. We also plan on making an android or ios client as well with the pc client. 

This will make our product more desirable for users that are more frequently mobile gamers, as well as newer players with the ability to see possible moves and good rule explanation.

Competitors probably didnâ€™t focus on the mobile gaming market because of the possible difficulty of implementing a mobile client. There are major differences between the various platforms, including monetization, styles and frameworks. There will also bet differences in marketing, promotion and branding, as the targetted user group becomes much larger.
