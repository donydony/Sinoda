# Summary

#### 1. Objective

Build a Two-Player board game that has similar gameplay to Sinoda, having a board and a certain amount of dice for each player. Each player can either roll the dice or move the dice in their turn, one action each turn and switch turn after one's done. Moving dice can capture the opponent's dice, and the game ends when one player's all dice got captured. 

#### 2. Personas

JS is a UTM student obsessed with playing the board game, like Sinoda, since he was a child. After his dad bought him a laptop for his 18th birthday, he developed his interest in playing video games on Steam. SJ is his twin's brother who has a similar story to JS, except he ends up getting in Waterloo. 

#### 3. Scenarios

SJ and JS often take trains to another's campus playing Sinoda, but taking a huge board and dice along the trip is so inconvenient.  They downloaded Sinoda on their computer and mobile so they can play it either online or offline. 

#### 4. Principles

Game settings and rules should be simple and easy to understand, easy for players to use. Smooth animation and game stability are important too. Simulate Sinoda in real life as much as possible, or add new content or new gameplay.
