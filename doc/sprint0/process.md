We  have decided to work on BSGames' game Sinoda. We made these decision during our meeting on Wednesday Jan 26 on Discord. After making some inquiries to the project owners. This decision is made by having a vote during our Wednesday meeting. During the process we will meet every Monday and Wednesday at 8pm any additional meeting will be arranged by the individuals scheduling the meetings. We have already came up with a project backlog and got it ranked by the project owners (see PB.md).
